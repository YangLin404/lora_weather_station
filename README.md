# Introduction

For this project, 2 [LORAWAN Rapid Development Kits](http://www.allthingstalk.com/lorawan-rapid-development-kit) are available from www.allthingstalk.com.  

These kits come with access to the following websites:
* https://maker.allthingstalk.com  
* https://devs.enco.io/dashboard  

Account details are identical for both sites:  
* username = kristof.lievens@i8c.be  
* password = L0Ra2017!  

As a first step, follow these tutorials to get up and running:
* http://docs.allthingstalk.com/tutorials/setup-lora-rapid-development-kit/  
* http://docs.enco.io/docs/getting-started-with-enco  

Because of problems with the Proximus network to deliver ACK messages, a LoRa gateway was also bought from https://webshop.ideetron.nl/LORANK-8.
It has been [registered](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/gateways/register) on https://www.thethingsnetwork.org using the account:
