When the gateway is online it will show up on the [semtech website](http://iot.semtech.com/gateways/).

## Step 2

## Step 3  

The next step is to [registrate your gateway](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/gateways/register) on the TheThingsNetwork. The ID of the gateway can be found on the [webpage of the gateway](http://lorank8/).

## Step 4

The following step is to create an application. You can create an application [here](https://console.thethingsnetwork.org/applications/add).
